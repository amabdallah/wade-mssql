Description
----------

* This is the v0.2 version of the MSSQL WaDE database

* This software is in the public domain, containing materials that came from the Water Data Exchange (WaDE) program, a project of the Western States Water Council (WSWC). 

* WSWC initiated the Water Data Exchange or WaDE project to address the difficulty accessing and creating comparable metrics from state water agency data related to water administration and planning, and to create a framework where states could share data with each other and the public in a more streamlined and cost-effective way. WaDE seeks to provide better access to water allocation, supply, and demand data that are maintained by state and other governmental agencies.
